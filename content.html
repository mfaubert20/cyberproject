            <h3 style="font-size: large; font-style: inherit; text-align: center;"> Authentication</h3>
            <P>Authentication is the term given to processes like logging in with a user id and password. 
                Two-factor authentication and strong passwords improve security. Password entropy measures 
                how difficult it is to crack a password. A password manager helps with security and retrieval 
                of passwords. Hackers use what's termed a brute force attack to uncover a password, and sometimes 
                a dictionary attack. Hackers gather accessible information about a person, and form a rainbow table, 
                to uncover passwords. Digital Certificates are used to verify identity, but even these can be faked. </P>

            <h2 style="font-size: medium; font-style: inherit;"> Anti-Virus Software</h2>

            <h3 style="font-size: large; font-style: inherit; text-align: center;">Fighting Malware</h3>
            <p>Anti-virus software looks for a virus signature on files that are on the computer or other device. 
                If found, the software is put into quarantine to allow reinstatement if harmless, or prevent 
                activating the malware. This software should be updated to ensure that more recent virus 
                signatures are recognized.
                Careful about downloading antivirus software, in response to a virus hoax.
                
                Firewalls help to block malware, and should be enabled and updated.</p>

            <h2 style="font-size: medium; font-style: inherit;"> Intrusion</h2>
            <img src="intrusion.png"alt="cybersecurity" width="60" height="60px">
            <h3 style="font-size: large; font-style: inherit; text-align: center;">Malware That Infiltrates</h3>
            <P>Online intrusion has taken the dangers of malware to a new level. This form of malware usually 
                begins with a Worm or Trojan setting up a backdoor. These types of intrusion are common: RAT, 
                Ransomware,Botnet, Zero Day Attack.
                Keep intrusions out by using a firewall, and by being careful about open ports.
                
                Organizations typically use an IDS to help prevent intrusion attacks.</P>

            <h2 style="font-size: medium; font-style: inherit;">Intereption</h2>
            <img src="intercept.png"alt="cybersecurity" width="60" height="60px">
            <h3 style="font-size: large; font-style: inherit; text-align: center;">Spying on Bytes</h3>
            <P>Interception exploits access computers and cell phones, software in an automated vehicle. 
                These exploits can take the form of Spyware, Adware, Keyloggers,MITM/MIM attacks, Evil Twinattacks, 
                address spoofing, Digital Certificate Hacks and IMSI Catchers.
                Bad actors can exploit SSL and TLS to encrypt malicious content. SSL inspection is a 
                technique used to counter the impact of interception and forwarding..</P>
